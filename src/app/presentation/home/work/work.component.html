    <h1>Carma</h1>
    <p class="time">Oct. to Dec. 2023</p>
    <p class="description">Carma was an app that I conceived and developed over a period of 2 weeks. This application is particularly dear to me as it was through the Pomodoro technique that I learned to have intense concentration sessions. Carma is based on the Pomodoro method.

      I aimed to leverage the skills I acquired in the corporate world by incorporating tools like the Compose library for Android and principles of clean architecture. It was a project I thoroughly enjoyed working on, and it's now available on the Google Play Store!</p>

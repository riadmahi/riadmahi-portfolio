  <app-work assetPath="./assets/carma-thumbnail.png" name="Carma" date="Sept. 2023" description="Carma was an app that I conceived and developed over a period of 2 weeks. This application is particularly dear to me as it was through the Pomodoro technique that I learned to have intense concentration sessions. Carma is based on the Pomodoro method. I aimed to leverage the skills I acquired in the corporate world by incorporating tools like the Compose library for Android and principles of clean architecture. It was a project I thoroughly enjoyed working on, and it's now available on the Google Play Store!"></app-work>
  <h1>Work/Minerva</h1>
  <app-work assetPath="./assets/minerva-thumbnail.png" name="Minerva" date="Oct. 2023 to March 2024" description="Minerva is a project undertaken in collaboration with the University Grenoble Alpes faculty. Working with real clients, it was our responsibility to propose and implement a technical solution that catered to their needs. The primary learning objective was not only to manage a project but also to effectively communicate with the client in order to tangibly address their initial requirements.
Within this project, our clients sought a solution to replace the use of Excel for commercial calculations and historical data purposes. One of the highlighted aspects, which I personally conceptualized and contributed to, was designing and participating in the creation of a user-centered interface."></app-work>
